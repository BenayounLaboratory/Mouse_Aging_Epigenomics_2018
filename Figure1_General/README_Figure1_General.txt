**************************

* Generic_NGS_scripts
	- process_FQ.sh: Clean up raw ChIP fastq files for downstream analysis
	- map_and_BAM.sh: map ChIP-seq data to genomes
	- clean_BAM_FS.sh: Run Fixseq on BAM aligned file to remove duplicated reads
	
* ChIP-seq_processing
	This code is separated in 2 sections: 
		(i) pre-process each tissue separately (Heart_example is given)
		(ii) process all datasets within a uniform pipeline (All_tissues)
		
	- Heart_example
		- H3K4me3_breadth
			merge_bed_call_calibration_heart.sh: 
				(i) get all merged reads for meta-peak calling
				(ii) downsample each H3 ChIP to the lowest read number across H3 ChIPs
				(iii) get coverage histograms of meta-peaks across downsamplings of H3K4me3 ChIPs by 5% increments  
				(iv) find correct adjustment level (see get_cov_cdf_heart.R code)
				(v) call individual peaks with callibrated reads
				(vi) create a file with all breadth coverage of each sample across metapeaks
				(vii) create bedgraphs and beds for visualization
				
			get_cov_cdf_heart.R (needs files in ./hists/ to run program): 
				uses the "Breadth_compare_bundle" code to determine appropriate downsampling levels
				
		- H3K4me3_height_heart
			K4me3_height_Diffbind.R: uses diffbind to get normalized read densities in each sample over metapeaks
			(Input are mapped reads - files are too big for GitHub.)
			
		- H3K27ac_height_heart
			H3K27ac_typical_enhancer_heaight_changes_Heart.R: uses diffbind to get normalized read densities in each sample over metapeaks
			(Input are mapped reads - files are too big for GitHub.)

		- SuperEnhancer
			get_Enhancers_heart.sh:
				(i) get merged H3K27ac reads for meta-peak calling
				(ii) get stiched peaks within 12.5kb as in Super Enhancer paper  
				(iii) get coverage in reads over stitched enhancers for each ChIP sampe
				(vi) create a file with all coverage of each sample across metapeaks/enhancers

			SuperEnhancer-Lite_analysis_UPDATED.R: call super enhancers across samples, and run diffbind to get normalized read densities in each sample over meta super enhancers

	- All_tissues
		- Breadth_modeling
			Merge_H3K4me3_breadth_files.pl: script called to combine breadth calling over tissues for general PCA/MDS analysis (input files in Breadth_Files; see README for function call)
			Get_global_clustering_v2.R: general MDS/PCA analysis using output of above
			
			process_breadth_datasets_linear_model_vPCA.R: process differential breadth over all tissues with uniform pipeline

		- H3K27ac_height (the scripts are modified from H3K4me3_height to use the H3K27ac input, so example files are not included)
			Get_global_clustering.R: general MDS/PCA analysis (merged file generated with Merge_H3K4me3_height_files.pl script, as input files are in the same format, as are desired outputs)

			Process_height_H3K27ac_linear_modeling_with_reseq_cor.R: process differential H3K27ac height over all tissues with uniform pipeline
			H3K27ac_height_analysis_functions_linear_v2.R: functions called by above script
			
		- SuperEnhancer (the scripts are modified from H3K4me3_height to use the SE input, so example files are not included)
			Merge_SE_files.pl: combine Super Enahncer intensity calling over tissues for general PCA/MDS analysis (see README for function call)
			Get_global_clustering.R: general MDS/PCA analysis
			Process_height_in SE_H3K27ac_linear_modeling_with_reseq_PCA.R: process differential H3K27ac height at super enahncers over all tissues with uniform pipeline
			SE_H3K27ac_height_analysis_functions_linear_vPCA.R: functions called by above script


* Breadth_compare_bundle: collection of code used for differential H3K4me3 breadth calling (called in the above scripts)
